## arpes_motors:
DONE

## beamline_energy:
- move ID, mono and slit 
- define accessible range of energy vs grating and polarization

## detectors:
- set detector i.e. redefine tth = 0 (DIAL/USER offset) for the selected detector 
- set gain for SRSs (1 to 4)
- set counting time for the scalers; include all of the following
    - S2: TEY  
    - S3: big diode (d3)
    - S4: small diode (d4)
    - S5: MCP
    - S14: mesh

## diagnostic:
DONE

## eps:
- get main shutter status
- open / close shutters (main, C and D)
- open / close chamber valves (C and D)
- check branch shutter (C or D) status and opens it if closed (depend on mirror position)
- check main shutter status and opens it if closed
- switch branch: move mirror, close/open shutters, turn off camera
- close branch (valve + shutter + MCP HV)
- close all valves
- close all shutters
- turn of all HV power supply
